## Usage
This application doesn't require any user interaction. It serves to display a message to your visitors. You can customize the message, style or layout by editing the HTML and inline CSS respectively.

## Technical Details
This application uses HTML5 and CSS3. It's styled with Bootstrap 5 for modern, responsive design. No JavaScript is used as the application doesn't require any interactivity or dynamic content. The project follows best practices for modern, semantic HTML and CSS.

## Code Explanation
The project consists of a single HTML file. Within the body tag, there's a heading (h1) tag with an id of "hello". This is the main content of the page.

The CSS provides styles for the body and the h1 tag, including centering the text both horizontally and vertically, setting the font size, and applying a background color.
